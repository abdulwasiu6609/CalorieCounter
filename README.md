# CalorieCounter
**Project Title:** Calorie Counter Web Application

**Overview:**
The Calorie Counter Web Application is a user-friendly tool designed to help individuals track their daily calorie intake and expenditure, assisting them in maintaining a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle. This project provides a simple yet effective interface for users to input their daily food consumption and exercise activities, calculate the remaining calories based on a predefined budget, and visualize their progress.

**Features:**

1. **Input Forms:** The application offers separate input sections for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and exercise. Users can add multiple entries for each section, providing the name and calorie content of the consumed food or performed exercise.

2. **Validation:** Input fields are validated to ensure that only numeric values are accepted for calorie counts. Additionally, the application checks for invalid scientific notation inputs to maintain data integrity.

3. **Calorie Calculation:** Upon submission of the form, the application calculates the total consumed calories from the input fields and subtracts them from the daily budgeted calories. It also considers the calories burned through exercise. The result is displayed, indicating whether the user has a surplus or deficit of calories.

4. **Clear Functionality:** Users have the option to clear the form, allowing them to start afresh or make corrections to their entries.

5. **Responsive Design:** The web application is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and functionality across various devices and screen sizes.

**Technologies Used:**

- **HTML5:** Used for structuring the web page content and creating form elements.
- **CSS3:** Styled the application for an aesthetically pleasing user interface and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented the logic for input validation, calorie calculation, and user interaction.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Utilized the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the user interface based on user input and application logic.

**Project Outcome:**
The Calorie Counter Web Application provides users with a convenient way to monitor their dietary habits and physical activities, empowering them to make informed decisions towards achieving their health and fitness goals. With its intuitive interface and accurate calorie tracking, the application contributes to promoting healthier lifestyles and fostering awareness of nutritional choices.
